    <p>Podívejte se na výsledky <a href="./data/medzinarodne/Vienna-2017-speaker.pdf" target="_blank">řečníků</a> a <a href="./data/medzinarodne/Vienna-2017-team.pdf" target="_blank">týmů</a>.</p>
    <p>Turnajové tézy:
      <ul>
        <li>This House would ban religious prison rehabilitation programmes.</li>
        <li>This House believes that "morals clauses" should not be allowed in contracts.</li>
        <li>This House would ban embedded journalism. (Information slide: Embedded journalists are attached to military units in a combat zone to allow them to report from otherwise dangerous areas. Journalists not attached to such units would normally report from designated safe areas away from the front line e.g. "The Green Zone" in Baghdad. Their continued participation in such schemes is regulated and subject to the withdrawal of credentials by the government.)</li>
        <li>This House believes that social movements and advocacy groups should reject the support, financial or otherwise, from organisations, including politicians and governments, which do not share their predominant values.</li>
        <li>This House, as China, would cease support of the North Korean regime, until they give up their nuclear program.</li>
        <li><strong>SEMI-FINAL MOTION</strong>: It is 1945. This House, as Otto Frank, would choose not to publish Anne Frank's diary. (Infoslide: Anne Frank was a Jewish Dutch girl who hid in an attic in Amsterdam with her family and several other families, until her eventual capture by the Nazis. She kept a personal diary starting a year before she went into hiding, until her discovery. The diary was very personal, and besides describing her thoughts about living in hiding, included discussions of her sexual awakening, and of her self-image, among other things. She did not concieve of it becoming public. After the war the diary was published posthumously by her father Otto Frank after the diary was found by the owner of the house in which they hid. It has become one of the most widely recognized pieces of holocaust literature.)</li>
        <li><strong>FINAL MOTION</strong>: This House regrets the emergence of New-Age religions. (Information slide: "New age religions" are Westernised versions of Eastern religions which focus heavily on "spirituality" rather than traditional laws and texts.)</li>
      </ul>
